The purpose of this project is to use machine learning models to attempt to beat the average market return of the S&P 500. We used API data from FinancialModelingPrep.com from 2009-2018 to train and test our models. 

The machine learning was done using logistic regression, neural networks, and KNN models. Our logistic regression model performed very well, outperforming the average S&P 500 return by over 100% when compared over a 10 year period. 

We finished by running that model over financial data from 2017-18 to generate a list of over 100 stocks that the model predicts will outperform the S&P 500 over the next 10 years. Results to be determined!

This project is a joint collaboration between Nathan Otsuka, Matthew Kacmarski, and Michael Dutton.
